<h2>The Break from Tradition</h2>

    <p>
        Modern art emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a reaction against traditional forms of art, particularly academic painting and realism. Artists sought new ways to express the rapidly changing world around them, often breaking away from classical perspectives, proportions, and techniques. Movements like Impressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism challenged established norms and experimented with form, color, and abstraction. This shift allowed artists to represent subjective experiences and emotions rather than just realistic depictions of the external world. The emphasis moved towards innovation and individual expression, which became the defining features of modern art.

    <p>
        Q: Which artist is credited with leading the Cubist movement, and how did it change art?
    </p>
<p>
    A: Pablo Picasso is widely recognized as a pioneer of Cubism. Along with Georges Braque, he deconstructed objects into geometric shapes, allowing multiple viewpoints to be shown simultaneously on a flat surface. This revolutionary style redefined how space and form could be represented in art.

    <h2>The Role of Technology and Society</h2>

    <p>
        As society modernized, so did art. The industrial revolution, urbanization, and the advent of photography influenced modern artists to think differently about their work. Photography, in particular, freed artists from the need to create realistic depictions, enabling them to explore abstract concepts and emotions. The rapid pace of technological change also mirrored the dynamism seen in modernist artworks, with movements like Futurism celebrating speed, machinery, and innovation. Artists were deeply influenced by these societal changes, and their work often reflected a world in flux, grappling with ideas of progress, alienation, and modernity.

    <h3>Did You Know?</h3>

    <p>
        Q: How did photography influence the rise of abstract art? 

    </p>
<p>
    A: With the invention of photography, artists no longer needed to focus solely on realism. This allowed them to experiment with abstraction, leading to movements like Abstract Expressionism and De Stijl, where color, form, and emotion took precedence over lifelike representation.
